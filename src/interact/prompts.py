Task: Generate a single, resilient step of Playwright code in Python that:
    - Intelligently adapts to the current workflow context
    - Learns from previous execution errors
    - Returns a small description and a boolean value indicating if this is the last step

```xml
<context>
    <user_command>{user_command}</user_command>
    <previous_steps>{previous_steps}</previous_steps>
    <elements>{elements}</elements>
    <variables>{variables}</variables>
    <previous_attempt>{previous_attempt}</previous_attempt>
    <traceback>{traceback}</traceback>
</context>
```

The Playwright code you generate will be executed in the following manner:
```python
async def execute_code(page, code_body: str, variables: dict):
    namespace = {{}}
    function_code = f\"\"\"{{code_body}}\"\"\"
    try:
        exec(function_code, globals(), namespace)
        dynamic_function = namespace["dynamic_function"]
        return await dynamic_function(page, variables)
    except Exception as e:
        return False, traceback.format_exc()
```

Code Generation Requirements:
    - Core Requirements:
        - Start with a async function definition statement `async def dynamic_function(page, variables) -> Tuple[bool, str]:` and add the code body after it, make sure the function name is dynamic_function and arguments are page and variables
        - Playwright is used in the async mode hence await all async methods
        - All code must be properly indented with 4 spaces and formatted properly for Python execution
        - Don't use 'networkidle' instead use 'domcontentloaded' and add wait for 'domcontentloaded' for each step
        - The function returns a tuple of (success_boolean, traceback.format_exc() in case of exception else empty string)
        - Access variables by dictionary key: variables['VARIABLE_NAME']
        - Don't add any import statements and assume the traceback module is available
        - Don't catch any specific exceptions and only catch generic 'Exception'
        - If elements are not found using a query, return as error message
        - Add timeouts of maximum 3000ms for actions like click, fill, hover etc. and quickly move to next element if not successful
    - Reliability Requirements:
        - Add multiple retries for failed actions and failure detection
        - Add necessary print statements
        - Implement appropriate waits and assertions where necessary
    - Ambiguity Handling (HIGH PRIORITY):
        - Add try except block to handle ambiguity
        - Give high priority to id, class_name, type selectors and use others only in fallback scenarios
        - Don't directly use playwright click method, instead query analyse and then click. Follow the same strategy for other actions like fill, hover, etc.
        - By default select all elements for the selector chosen
        - Handle cases where multiple elements match by selecting the most appropriate one
        - If logic fails with one element, try with other elements until success
        - Compare other details of the element to select the most precise element eg text of element, details which are not used in selecting element
    - Error Learning (CRITICAL):
        - When <previous_attempt> and <traceback> are provided, that means the previous step failed with same configuration. The code you generate should:
            - Perform deep analysis of the error root cause
            - Don't repeat the exact approach that previously failed and develop a new approach
            - Add additional error handling specifically targeting the previous failure point

            
Guidelines to follow for generating steps:
    - Atomic & Adaptive Logic:
        - Generate only ONE step representing the immediate next action
        - Each step should be concise, specific, and actionable
        - When possible, combine related actions on the same page that would typically perform without waiting for page changes
    - Progression Logic:
        - Review <previous_steps> to maintain logical workflow progression
        - Avoid repeating previous steps
        - Ensure the step advances toward fulfilling the user command
    - Element-Aware Decision Making:
        - Elements are formatted in json format
        - Analyze the <elements> list to identify the most appropriate interaction targets
        - Elements represent the top 100 interactive elements currently visible on the page
        - If <elements> is empty, this indicates the first step (typically navigation to a URL)
        - Use element properties (id, class_name, text, etc.) to precisely identify interaction targets
    - Variable-Aware Decision Making:
        - The <variables> section contains keys for sensitive information that will be injected later
        - Only variable names/keys are provided, not the actual values
        - Determine which variable to use based on the current context and element purpose
    - Don't include browser initialization or tab opening steps

    
Past common error scenarios to account for (HIGH PRIORITY):
    - 'Page' object has no attribute 'wait_for_navigation', don't use wait_for_navigation method
    - coroutine 'Page.query_selector_all' was never awaited
    - coroutine 'Locator.element_handles' was never awaited
    - For elements with multiple classes, use class_name to select the element, replace all spaces with dots. Eg: selector for class_name "block cursor-pointer whitespace-nowrap" is ".block.cursor-pointer.whitespace-nowrap"


Element Model Reference
```python
class BrowserElement(BaseModel):
    text: str = ""         # Text content of the element
    tag_name: str = ""     # HTML tag (button, input, a, div, etc.)
    id: str = ""           # ID attribute
    class_name: str = ""   # CSS class names
    href: str = ""         # Link URL (for <a> tags)
    type: str = ""         # Type attribute (for inputs)
    placeholder: str = ""  # Placeholder text (for inputs)
    role: str = ""         # ARIA role
```
